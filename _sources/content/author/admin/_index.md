I am a postdoctoal researcher at NOAA/GFDL and Princeton University working with Dr. Nat Johnson. Currently, my research interests are the dynamics of tropical-extratropical teleconnections and its applications on prediction skills. I am also interested in numerical modeling (e.g. barotropic model, ENSO intermediate model and cumulus parameterizations), artificial intelligence (e.g. Neural Networks and Deep Learning) and statistical method. Detailed information can be referred to my "Publications".
