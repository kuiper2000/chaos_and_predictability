# Week 3: The minimalist models for studying chaos and predictability I: Lorenz 63

In weeks 1 and 2, we introduced how to define predictability and some potential predictability sources in Earth atmosphere. This week, we will talk about the origins of predictability or chaos. Next to relativity and statistical mechanics, chaos is probably one of the most groundbreaking discoveries in theoretical physics.
