# RB2D
This is a 2D simulation of Rayleigh-Bernard convection in the Boussinesq approximation. 
This code is written using a python distrobution called the Dedalus project. 
Dedalus can solve almost arbitrary partial differential equations inputted in plain text providing there is adequate boundary conditions. 

The code also comes with several analysis tools, and the ability to change the resolution/timestepping method. 
Please also check out Dedalus project for a more in depth look at this distrobution, I am just a uni student who is doing a masters project on simulating convection in the sun.
