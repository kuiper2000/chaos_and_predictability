# Week 7: The stability theory

In week 6, we learn how to estimate the time evolution of PDF. We can easily find that the analytical solution of LE (i.e., {eq} `eq64`) follows a form of exponential function, where the integral inside the exponent represents the state-dependent error growth rate. For example, if the integral is negative, indicating the volume (density) spanned by ensemble members will increase (decrease) with time at that given location. Thus, it's pretty much like a stability problem we usually deal with at the traditional geophysical fluid dynamics. For example, in mid-latitude, some regions with strong meridional temperature gradient (vertical wind shear), we can see frontal genesis. These regions have very strong baroclinicity and thus a small disturbance can easily grow. In atmospheric dynamics, we can estimate the Eady growth rate, which is defined as $0.31\frac{f_0}{NH}\Delta U$ (where $f_0$ is planetary Coriolis Force, $NH$ is the square of Brunt-Vaisala frequency and $\Delta U$ is the vertical wind shear).
