# Syllabus 

This is a course which will help you walk through some fundamental ideas in chaos (a.k.a. Butterfly effect), predictability and information theory. The goal is to learn how to (1) qualitatively and quantatively describe "predictability", (2) physically interpret a dynamical systems and (3) find the optimal patterns favoring model error growth in various systems. Prerequisites for this course including: applied math (ODE, PDE and linear algebra), numerical analysis, statistics and atmospheric dynamics.   


:::{note}
This is the v1.0 handout of the course "Chaos and Predictability" taught in the [Department of Atmospheric Science](http://www.as.ntu.edu.tw/index.php/eng), [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/chinese2007/english/index.html). There might be tons of typos. Feel free to let me know (email Dr. Kai-Chih Tseng: kaichiht@princeton.edu)
